traction across a multitude of domains including surveillance, logistics, agriculture, disaster management, and military operations. To maintain effective UAV operations, it is crucial to accurately detect and classify their flight states, such as hovering, cruising, ascending, or transitioning between these modes. Conventional Time Series Classification (TSC) methods often lack the robustness and generalization required for dynamic and heterogeneous UAV environments, while state-of-the-art models such as Transformers and Long Short Term Memory (LSTM)-based architectures typically demand large datasets and incur high computational costs, especially when handling high-dimensional data streams. In this paper, we propose a novel Transformer-based Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) framework integrated with Multiple Instance Locally Explainable Learning (MILET) to tackle these challenges in UAV flight state classification. The proposed method leverages a Transformer encoder to capture long-range temporal dependencies and complex dynamics from UAV telemetry, while a GAN is employed to augment limited training datasets with realistic synthetic samples. MIL principles are integrated to effectively handle high-dimensional inputs by focusing attention on the most discriminative segments, thereby mitigating noise and computational overhead. The experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method, achieving the highest classification accuracy of 96.5\% on the \textit{DroneDetect} dataset and 98.6\% on the \textit{DroneRF} dataset compared to other state-of-the-art methods. The framework excels in computational efficiency and robust generalization across various UAV platforms and flight states. These results underscore its strong potential for real-time deployment in resource-constrained environments, offering a scalable and resilient solution for UAV flight state classification in dynamic and complex operational scenarios.
